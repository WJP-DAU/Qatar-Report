## METHODOLOGY

To present an image that accurately portrays the rule of law as experienced by ordinary people, data in this report is drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), an original data source designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP). The GPP captures the experiences and perceptions of ordinary people concerning the performance of the state and its agents and the actual operation of the legal framework in their country.

The General Population Poll used to collect data in Qatar in 2024 features questions that highlight perceptions on issues salient to the region, including corruption, authoritarian behaviors, police performance, criminal justice, and security. The GPP in Qatar was administered to a sample of 503 respondents.

## DATA COLLECTION

The GPP in Qatar was conducted for the WJP's *The Rule of Law in Qatar* report with sampling, fieldwork, and data processing by AMRC Insights and Market Dive, based in the United Arab Emirates. AMRC administered the surveys face-to-face during the months of September to December 2024, conducting Computer-Assisted Personal Interviews (CAPI) using a stratified random sampling design in the field. The target population group for this survey included individuals aged 18 years or older across the country, encompassing both Qatari citizens and foreign residents.

## SAMPLE SIZE AND SAMPLE FRAME

The General Population Poll in Qatar represents an achieved total sample size of 503 interviews distributed proportionally across the countryâ€™s municipalities. AMRC based the sampling frame on 2020 census figures and the Household Expenditure and Income Survey from the Authority of Planning and Statistics, along with urbanization data from the World Bank. This allowed AMRC to acquire a sample proportionally stratified by municipality, age, gender, socioeconomic status, citizenship, and level of urbanization.

To address all relevant topics while controlling the questionnaire length, the WJP split three of the survey modules into two versions (Option A and Option B) and randomly assigned one option to each respondent for each module. These modules included: Hypothetical Situations, Civic Participation, and Institutional Performance. Aside from these modules, the questionnaires are identical. A link to the complete survey instrument in Arabic and English can be found in the Appendix of this report.

## SAMPLING

Municipalities were selected as the primary sampling unit to achieve a nationally representative sample of the country. The surveys were conducted face-to-face, and survey participants were randomly selected through a door-to-door approach from households identified according to the established household selection method. The sample was stratified according to quotas for age, gender, geographic distribution, socioeconomic level, citizenship, and level of urbanization. The sampling plan was approved by WJP before the start of fieldwork.

## INTERVIEWING AND QUALITY CONTROL

Within each selected household, respondents were chosen using the Kish Grid, ensuring that the selection process remained random and unbiased. Quotas were applied to ensure proportional representation of the targeted demographic groups. Once the sample size for a specific target group was achieved, the scripted survey automatically closed the questionnaire for that group. Interviewers then replaced the household with closed quotas and continued the process until respondents matching the criteria for the remaining quotas were found. 

The average interview length was approximately 29 minutes. Interviews were conducted in Arabic and English.
