## DATA REVIEW AND JUSTIFICATION

As part of the data analysis process, the team consulted several third-party sources in order to contextualize and validate perception-based data captured by the General Population Poll. Peer data sources consulted include select indicators measured by Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), Transparency International's *Corruption Perceptions Index*, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's *Transformation Index (BTI)*, Freedom House's *Freedom in the World*, as well as specialized reports from Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty International. While certain trends captured by the 2024 General Population Poll in Qatar are comparable to captured perceptions data measured by other organizations, the perceptions presented in this report may not always coincide with the reality of Qatar rule of law performance as measured by other sources.
