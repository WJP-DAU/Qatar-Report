<b class="c-purple">EFFECTIVE RULE OF LAW</b> reduces corruption, combats poverty and disease, and protects people from injustices large and small. Strengthening the rule of law is an important objective for governments, donors, and civil society organizations around the world. To be effective, rule of law development requires clarity about the fundamental features that define the rule of law, as well as an adequate basis for its evaluation and measurement.  

<i>The Rule of Law in Qatar: Key Findings from the General Population Poll 2024</i> presents a comprehensive analysis of Qatar’s rule of law ecosystem with new data collected and analyzed using the methodological framework of the <i>WJP Rule of Law Index®</i>, the world’s leading source of original, independent rule of law data. The findings in this report feature question-level data drawn from the General Population Poll (GPP), one of the original data sources designed and collected by the World Justice Project (WJP) to inform the annual Index reports.

The GPP was designed to capture data on the experiences and perceptions of ordinary people regarding a variety of themes related to the rule of law. The poll for this report was conducted through face-to-face interviews to a nationally representative sample of 503 Qatari households between September and December 2024. The data derived from the GPP is presented in this report as thematic briefs, each one highlighting a different dimension of the rule of law from the perspective of people living in Qatar.
